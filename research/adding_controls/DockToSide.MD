# Dock To Side

One solution to the problem is to use a "Side docking window". Such a window would attach to the site of a standard windows Dialog giving the extra required controls while still keeping the FileOpenDialog default and clean. Such a GUI could even be opened from a seperate small GUI bound to the side of the window.
